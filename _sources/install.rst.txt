Installation
============

xtalmet can be installed via pip. It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) $ pip install xtalmet

At the moment (Nov 18th, 2025), the above command will install version 0.1.0.
However, we recommend installing the pre-release version, 1.0.0a1, since it has many improvements over version 0.1.0. 
You can install version 1.0.0a1 with the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) $ pip install --pre xtalmet
